This project is something I designed and coded myself for a final project. It has all the functionality of a regular website, including being able to log in/register as a user, create events and find events you are looking for. The purpose of this app is to allow solo travellers to find groups to travel with while avoiding pre-made itineraries and costs from travel groups. You can find others planning trips or plan one yourself and allow people to join, all while getting to price it out into your preferred budget and interests.
