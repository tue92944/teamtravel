# TeamTravel

#### TeamTravel is an application geared towards solo travelers. It is hard to find a group of people to travel with, and the pricing and detailed itineraries of group travel websites is too much sometimes. With TeamTravel, you are able to create trips, and join trips that others are creating based off your preferences.

## Features

#### -User Login/Register form with validations
#### -Dashboard with popular trip recommendations to browse through
#### -Create an event page where you can create/update new events
#### -My Trips page where you can manage all your current trips / RSVPS and update or delete as needed
